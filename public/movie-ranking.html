<h1>The Best Anime According to Niine</h1>

<h2>My top 3 animes of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Bleach</h3>
<p>You know I just love the story and how the world is built around. 
Every Zanpakuto has a name and a souk so this is really amazing. 
The villans are awsome and I really admire the protagonist.</p>

<h3>One Piece</h3>
<p>Basically the GOAT anime, but for me it's second because I just like Bleach more, 
but it is one the best animes ever created though it is very long.
  The world building is astonishing and the depth in every character is remarkable.</p>

  <h3>Jujutsu Kaisen</h3>
<p>It is one of the greatest animes from the new gen. 
It is gripping and it has one of the best animations and fight scenes ever created.
It has one of the best villans of all of anime and it is not even finished yet so it even has room to grow.
